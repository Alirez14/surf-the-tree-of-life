- implement a search input on top of the list page 
- the search bar should have 1.5 sec delay (debounce) and then the list should get filtered by it through the DB eg: Ba -> bacteria... 
- clicking on species name expands the row and shows complete data of the species [name,extinct,_id,parent,confidence]
- expanded mode contains text area that the user can add/modify comment about the species
- previous comment must be default value of the text area
- comment modification is going to be save to the DB after second click that close the expand mode

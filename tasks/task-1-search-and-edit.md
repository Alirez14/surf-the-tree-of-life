Search for and edit species
===========================

Add a search bar on top of the species list. When the user inputs something into the search bar the list of species should automatically be filtered, in the background, and shown to the user.

Clicking on a species name expands the list entry and shows the complete data of the species, e.g. its name, whether it is extinct or not, the parent species, and the confidence. Clicking on the name a second time closes the list entry.

The expanded list entry should have a text input that allows the user to enter a comment about the species. When the user closes the expanded entry the comment is saved to the database. In case a comment already exists it is shown inside the text input.

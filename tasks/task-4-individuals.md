Individuals
===========

We want to track individuals of a species. Therefore we need the following features
- a page to create/and update an individual
- a individual should have at least a name, belong to a species and have an owner (name of the person that own this individual)

Moreover we need a list of all the individuals in the database. This list should be sortable by the name of the individual, the species, or the name of the owner.
